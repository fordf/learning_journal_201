# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 13

The only new thing introduced today was localStorage, which is an easy way to store and persist useful state data on the client's browser. So we modified our BusMall sites to store the accumulated data (clicks, timesShown) in local storage and build on top of the previous data rather than reset every time the site was reloaded. We simply stored and updated the product objects from which we could retrieve the clicks, timesShown, etc. properties. localStorage stores everything as strings, so JSON is used to 'stringify' data that can then later be parsed back into useable data. I pair programmed with Michael, and I think I did better this time. I don't have any good project ideas, and I'm too tired to think now. Python guys gave us the overview/demo/pitch and I think it actually changed my mind. The kind of stuff done with python appeals to me a little more than pure javascript. I like js but I don't have much of an idea what I would really want to do with it. Still deciding.
