# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 2

Since the last journal entry, we've covered a lot: control flow (for/while loops), conditional statements (if/else if/else), the box model, scaffolding with unix, a bunch of new html tags and css properties, and how to design websites with the end user in mind. We also learned how Javascript has weak typing with truthy and falsy values that can get pretty confusing.
