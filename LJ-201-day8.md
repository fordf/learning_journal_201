# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 8

Lecture: Did a code review on Avery's cookie code, which was cool because we used a lot of the same ideas, but he implemented them much differently than I did. He made cool functions to turn the random customers/cookies per hour into a semi-bell curve. It breaks the min and max values but it creates a more realistic representation of cookie sales at an real cookie store. I was going for a similar effect, but I just sorted the list so there are never any 'mini peaks'. Sales go up ever hour until halfway, and go down after that. In reality, the slope of the curve would be more random, and only on average will the curves be a clear bell curve, peaking at the peak sales hour (which I'm assuming is the midpoint). The focus today was on forms and events, which are what make JS so awesome, so I was pretty stoked to try em, but scared because this was the first topic that I hadn't been exposed to at all prior. But it made sense, and if you work through the event in chronological order it's not bad. I ended up writing a butt lode of code and got it all working perfectly, I think, which is really satisfying. Can't get over confident or cocky though, only reason I'm doing so well is because I'm working like a maniac. Gotta keep challenging myself. Eventually I'll start 'failing' more but I won't let it affect me.
