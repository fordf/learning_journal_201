# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

Well they say tomorrow's going to be harder and the day after that will be harder still, but today was hard. We introduced objects and talked about the importance of domain modeling. The difficult thing today was lab, because we had to make these large objects using literal notation that would represent salmon cookie stores and how many cookies and customers the store handles per hour and per day. The math to generate the numbers was relatively easy. Putting that data into some object was tricky. We could've put the customers/cookies per hour into arrays, but I put that combined data into this object with objects for each hour with the corresponding values. It was a challenge, but it felt good figuring it out and working the bugs out.
