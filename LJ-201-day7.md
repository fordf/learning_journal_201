# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 7

Introduced constructors that allow the creation of generalized objects. It's not a totally new topic to me. I saw it back in HS with Java and in the Codecademy tutorials. I knew how to make tables too, but I didn't remember the header tags, and I certainly didn't know how to build a table with JS. Once the pattern for doing that gets into your head it's not too confusing, but it's easy to forget a step. I'm finding writing code to be a great combo of fun and challenge. Glad I'm doing this.
