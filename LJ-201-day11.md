# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 11

In lecture, we reviewed the reading on video, audio, and practical knowledge (like SEO and hosting). We also built the wireframe out in class, and it was interesting how differently I did it.

I'll have to be creative to add more functionality to this thing (the BusMall marketing research thing).
