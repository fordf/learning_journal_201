# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 10

I was sick so I missed lab, but in lecture we talked about the right way to go about starting a project. Build the basic structure in HTML, go through and layout the html with css, add colors and fanciness, then add content. The iOS instructor gave a talk, and although I did find it interesting, I'm not sold on it. Still leaning towards FSJS.
